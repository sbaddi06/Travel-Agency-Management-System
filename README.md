# Travel-Agency-Management-System
Our Travel agency management system consists of hotels (5 star, 3 star and normal), and transport services (by road and by train). The present systems are inadequate in providing information customers about tours plans. Often agencies are compelled to rely on local information sources and count on their own experience regarding time and cost. The current agencies are almost forced to gather information regarding the services through phone calls and are often poorly managed. We provide information of hotel and transport through online fixed price for our customers, through which they can choose the right package which also fits their budget.
